# Straight Lines and Linear Graphs

Coordinates written as `(a, b) = (x, y)`

$x$ and $y$ axis:
- $x$ runs horizontally and contains the independent (non-changing) variable
- $y$ runs vertically and contains the dependent (changing) variable - 'y is to the sky'

####

### To sketch a graph:
1. Choose a value for one of the variables, $x$ or $y$
2. Sub the value of that variable into the equation to find a value for the other variable
3. The values for each variable will be the points `(x, y)`
4. Plot each point on the graph

### Straight line formula:
> $y=mx+c$
- If you a line suits this formula, you know it is straight and you will only have to find 2 points to sketch it
- You can sub any value into one of the variables to find the other (eg. 0), but make sure the situation allows it and there are no restrictions.
- In summary an equation is linear, if it has...
  - 1 term involving $x$, which may be 0
  - 1 term involving $y$, which may be 0
  - 1 constant term, which may be zero. This is $c$.
  - No powers other than 1. Therfore can't be square rooted either because that would be a power eg. $\sqrt{1} = 1^{1/2}$

### Important features of straight line equations
- $y$-intercept is the value of $y$ when $x=0$. This is $c$ in $y=mx+c$. On the graph, this is the value of $y$ when the line crosses the $y$-axis.
- $x$-intercept is the value of $x$ when $y=0$. On the graph, this is the value of $x$ when the line crosses the $x$-axis.
- The gradient of the graph is its slope. This can be calculated on the graph by the formula $\frac{rise}{run}$. It is how much the line rises as the the line goes across the $x$ axis. This is represented by $m$ in $y=mx+c$.
  - Note: If the gradient is negative, it slopes downward to the right. If it is positive, it slopes upward to the right.
