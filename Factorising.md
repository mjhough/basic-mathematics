# Factorising

##### If in the form: $2(x+1) + y(x+1)$:
- Becomes: $(x+1)(2+y)$

##### Perfect squares
- Of the form $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$
- Becomes $(a+b)(a+b)$ or $(a+b)^2$
#####
- Of the form $a^2 - 2ab + b^2$
- Becomes $(a-b)(a-b)$ or $(a-b)^2$

##### Difference between squares
- Of the form $a^2 - b^2$
- Becomes $(a+b)(a-b)$

##### Factorising quadratics
- Of the form $x^2+8x+7$
- Must find what multiplies to give 7 and adds to give 8.
- Because $x^2+8x+7=x^2+(d+e)x+de$
- In this case, $7+1=8$ and $7\times1$ = 7. Therefore, the factorised form is $(x+7)(x+1)$

##### Factorising quadratics with an x^2 coefficient > 1
- Of the form $ax^2+bx+c$
- We must find two numbers that add to give $b$ and multiply to give $a \times c$
- For example: $2x^2+9x+4$
- What multiplies to give $2\times4=8$?
- What sums to give $9$?
- $8$ and $1$
- Therefore in expanded form, it becomes: $2x^2+8x+x+4$
- Factorised this is $2x(x+4)+1(x+4)$
- Fully factorised, this becomes: $(2x+1)(x+4)$
