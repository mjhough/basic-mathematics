# Pythagoras Theorem with lines

## Finding the distance between two points
#### Method 1:
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ where $c^2$ is the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle (the longest side). The distance represented by $a$ must be either $x2-x1$ or $y2-y1$. The same goes for $b$, except it must be the opposite of the points used in $a$. Eg. if $a$ used $x2-x1$, then $b$ must be $y2-y1$.

This can be simplified to $h^2=(x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2$. Which can be solved by simply subbing the values in.

#### Method 2:
Using the distance formula:
$d=\sqrt{(x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2}$
