# Functions
Functions are written as $f(x) = x$, where whatever is in between the brackets is the input. In this case, the input is $x$. What is returned by the function is on the right hand side of the equals sign. In this case the function returns whatever is input.

For example, $f(x) = x^2$ just takes the input and squares it.

### Plotting functions
- For a function $f(x) = x+3$:
  - $f(x)$ is the dependent variable, therefore it is shown on the $y$-axis.
  - $x$ is the independent variable, therefore it is shown on the $x$-axis.
  - In standard form this equation looks like this $y=x+3$.

### Domain and range
Usually written in interval format.
- Domain
  - The entire set of numbers which can be used as valid inputs to the function.
- Range
  - The entire set of numbers which can possibly arise as outputs of the function.
