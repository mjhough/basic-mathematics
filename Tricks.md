### Tricks for finding factors
- 2: An integer will be divisble by two if the last digit is even.
- 3: A number is divisble by 3 if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.
- 4: A number will divide by 4 if the last 2 digits are divisible by 4.
- 5: A number will divide by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5
- 6: If an integer is divisible by both 2 and 3 it will be divisible by 6.
- 9: If the sum of digits of a number is divisible by 9, the whole number will divide by 9.
- 10: If an integer ends in - and has more than one digit it will be divisible by 10.

### Finding the Square Root of Small Numbers
1. Convert the number you want to find the square root of to a fraction. For example:
> $\sqrt{0.04}$ can be converted to... $\sqrt{\frac{4}{100}}$
2. Next find what squared will equal the fraction you just wrote down. Eg:
> $\sqrt{(\frac{2}{10})^2}$
3. Now we can easily extract the square root because the square root of a squared number is just the number itself:
> $\frac{2}{10}$
4. And the answer is $\frac{2}{10}$ or $0.2$
