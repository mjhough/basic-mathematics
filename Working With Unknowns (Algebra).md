> #### $2x + 4y \times 3x + 3x - y$

Given an equation like the one above, we can follow a simple method to simplify this equation:

1. Sort out the equation like you normally would with BEDMAS. Except only do the BEDM part (brackets, exponents, division, multiplication). For example:
> $2x + 4y \times 3x + 3x - y$
> $2x + 12xy + 3x - y$

2. Now you can continue with BEDMAS and add/subtract the like terms:
> $2x + 3x + 12xy - y$
> $5x + 12xy - y$

Because $2x$ and $3x$ are like terms (just with a different coefficient), they can be added together.
