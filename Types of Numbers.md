## Real Numbers
- Contain the below number subsets:

- #### Natural numbers
  - Denoted $\mathbb{N}$, are positive counting numbers
  - Example: $\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,4...\}$
  - $0\notin\mathbb{N}$

- #### Integers
  - Denoted $\mathbb{Z}$, are positive and negative whole numbers and zero
  - Example: $\mathbb{Z}=\{...,-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5...\}$ 

- #### Rational numbers
  - Denoted $\mathbb{Q}$, are the real numbers that can be represented in the form $\frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $b\neq0$
  - In decimal form, each rational number is a terminating or repeating decimal, e.g. $0.272727$ or $0.33333333$

- #### Irrational numbers
  - Denoted $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, are the real numbers that are not rational.
  - In decimal form, each irrational number is a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal, e.g. $\sqrt{2}$

- #### Complex (or imaginary) numbers
  - $\sqrt{-1}$ etc
