# Lines parrallel to the axis

####

## Horizontal lines:
- Have equations of the form $y=c$
- Always have a gradient = 0.
- This is because there is no rise in the formula $m=\frac{rise}{run}$, therefore $m=0$.

## Vertical lines:
- Have equations of the form $x=c$
- Always have a gradient of $undefined$.
- This is because there is no run in the formula $m=\frac{rise}{run}$, therefore $m=undefined$ because you can't divide by 0.
