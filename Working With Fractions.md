# Working With Fractions

### Multiplying Fractions
- Multiply by the numerators with each other and multiply the denominators with each other.
- Eg. $\frac{5}{2}\times\frac{3}{4}=\frac{5\times3}{2\times4}=\frac{15}{8}$

### Dividing Fractions
- Multiply the first fraction by the inverse of the second.
- Eg. $\frac{5}{2}\div\frac{3}{4}=\frac{5}{2}\times\frac{4}{3}=\frac{20}{6}$

### Converting Fractions To Their Simplest Form
- Factorise numerator and denominator into primes.
- Then divide by prime factors common to both the numerator and the denominator
 Eg. $\frac{28}{42}=\frac{28\div2}{42\div2}=\frac{14\div2}{21\div2}=\frac{2}{3}$
- Essentially, what common factor can you divide the numerator and denominator by to get the smallest possible number?

### Adding/Subtracting Fractions
- Must first make sure the denominators are the same. For example, you cannot do $\frac{2}{3}+\frac{3}{2}$. First the fractions must be converted to equivalent fractions.
- When converting fractions so that they are equivalent, we find the smallest number that is divisible by the two denominators. In the below example, 6 is divisble by both 3 and 2.
- Next, both the numerator and the denominator are multiplied by the number that will make the denominator equal the number we chose earlier that can be divded by the two denominators
- Eg.  $\frac{2}{3}+\frac{3}{2}=\frac{2\times2}{3\times2}+\frac{3\times3}{2\times3}=\frac{4}{6}+\frac{9}{6}=\frac{13}{6}$
