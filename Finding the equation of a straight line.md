# Finding the equation of a straight line

## When given a point on the line and the gradient of the line
1. Write out $y=mx+c$ and substitute the value of $m$ and $(x,y)$ in.
2. Rearrane the equation to find the value of $c$.
3. Now represent the line as $y=mx+c$, subbing in $c$ and $m$

## When given two points on the line
1. Calculate the gradient using the formula $m=\frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$ and sub $m$ into $y=mx+c$
2. Sub the values of the 1st or 2nd point into the equation to find c.
3. Represent the line as $y=mx+c$, subbing in $c$ and $m$

##### Note: When both x values are equal, the equation will be $x=constant$. If both y values are equal, the equation will be $y=constant$. The constant will be the equal points. Eg. The equation of the line passing through $(2, 4)$ and $(2, 4)$ is $x=2$.

## Finding the equation of a line parallel to another with a point
Two lines are parallel if their gradients are the same.
1. We already have $m$ from the equation of the other line, so we just need to sub the point in to $y=mx+c$ to find $c$
2. Once we have $c$, represent the line as $y=mx+c$, subbing in $m$ and $c$. The gradients of each line should be the same.

## Finding the equation of a line perpendicular to another with a point
The line perpendicular to another has a gradient equal to $\frac{-1}{m}$ where $m$ is the gradient of the other line.
1. Find the gradient of the line using $\frac{-1}{m}$
2. Sub the point and the new gradient into $y=mx+c$ to find $c$.
3. Once $c$ is found, represent the line as $y=mx+c$, subbing in $c$ and $m$.
