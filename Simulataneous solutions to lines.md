# Simulataneous solutions to lines
- If 2 lines intersect at one point then that point satisfies both equations at the same time. This is called a simultaneous solution to the equations, because it solves both equations simultaneously.
- If the lines do not intersect at all, they must be parallel. There is no simultaneous solution.
- If the lines intersect in an infinite number of points, then they must be the same line. There are an infinite  number of simultaneous solutions.

### Method 1 - substitution:
1. Choose one equation and isolate one of the variables on the left hand side. Eg. $x=7-3y$
2. Substitute the expression for that variable into the other equation. Eg. $3x-2y=10$ becomes $3(7-3y)-2y=10$.
3. Solve the equation for the remaining variable.
4. Substitute the found variable into either original equation (usually the other one) to find the other variable.
5. Solve again. You should now have both $x$ and $y$, forming a point: $(x,y)$.

### Method 2 - elimination:
1. Multiply one equation by a multiple of the other equation to eliminate one of the variables. For example:
> (1): $x-3y=-1$
> (2): $3x+2y=8$
Becomes:
> (1): $2x-6y=-2$ (multiplied by 2)
> (2): $9x+6y=24$ (multiplied by 3)

Now $-6y$ cancels out $6y$.
2. Add the left hand sides of the equations to each other and the right hand sides of the equations to each other:
> $11x=22$
3. Solve for the remaining variable:
> $x = \frac{22}{11}$
> $x=11$
4. Sub the found variable back into one of the equations to find the unfound variable.
5. You should now have a point $(x,y)$.

##### Note: If you get a statement that is never true, eg. $0=1$, it means that there is no solution to the given equations.
