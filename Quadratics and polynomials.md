# Quadratics and polynomials

### Polynomials
- Any function that involves a variable raised only to powers that are positive integers.
- The degree of a polynomial $P(x)$ is the highest power of $x$ in $P(x)$.
- A polynomial of degree 1 is **linear**, a polynomial of degree 2 is a **quadratic**, and a polynomial of degree 3 is a **cubic**.
- Eg.
> Linear: $2x + 3$
> Quadratic: $2x^2 + 3$
> Cubic: $2x^3 + 3$
> 

- Polynomials can be written as functions. Eg. if $y=x^2 + 2x + 1$, then it can also be written as $f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1$
- All polynomials involve a variable, eg. $x$.


##### Terminology
- In $5x^3 - 4x^2 + 3$, the '$x^2$ term' is $4x^2$, the coefficient of $x^3$ is 5, the coefficient of $x$ is 0, and the constant term is $3$.


#### Quadratics
- Polynomials in which the highest power of the variable is 2. Eg. $2x^2 + 3$
- The general form of a quadratic is $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants and $x$ is the variable.

##### Solving quadratics
- There can be 0, 1, or 2 roots as a solution for a quadratic equation.
- If a is positive, then the graph will take a smily face shape. If a is negative it will take a frowny face shape.
- Quadratic formula
  - $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
  - If $b^2-4ac > 0$ then this formula results in two distinct roots
  - If $b^2-4ac = 0$ then this formula results in one root
  - If $b^2-4ac < 0$ then there are no roots because we can't take the square root of a negative.
  - To use the quadratic formula, you must first write the equation in the form $ax^2+bx+c = 0$, where $y$ is $0$. $y$ is 0 because we are trying to find the two (or 1 or 0) points where the quadratic touches the $x$-axis. So $y$ must be 0.
  - Then sub in the values.
  - To find the $y$-intercept, we set $x$ to 0 and solve.
  - We should then have the 1, 2, or 3 $x$-intercepts (roots), and a $y$-intercept.

- Turning point formula
  - $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$
  - Finds the x coord of the turning point.

- Solving by factoring
  - We need to convert something like $x^2-3x+2 = 0$ to $(x-2)(x-1) = 0$
  - From there, we can easily solve the equation in our heads. One of brackets must be equal to 0, therefore to find our 2 roots we would set one of the brackets to 0 and solve. In this case, we get $x=1$ and $x=2$.
  - To get to the factorised point we must look at the equation and ask ourselves, in the case of $x^2-3x+2$ (in std form), what two numbers add together to give -3, and multiply together to give 2. The two numbers are $-2$ and $-1$.
  - We then write them in factorised form: $(x-2)(x-1)$ and solve.
  - Using the general formula ($ax^2+bx+c$), this is the same as asking what two numbers add to give $b$, and multiply to give $c$?
####
- Note: When solving quadratics, somemtimes one value is not realistic. Eg. if you get a negative value when trying to find the length of a triangle's side. In this case, throw away the negative value and keep the positive one. Or you did it wrong.

##### Sketching quadratics
- Need to find 3 points because of smiling or frowning shape of quadratic
