# Powers and Exponents

### Power Rule 1 (Product of Powers)
If a, m and n are all real numbers, then:
$a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}$
- note: the base must be the same in order to do this. You can't do $b^a \times c^e$

### Power Rule 2 (Dividing Powers)
If a,m and n are all real numbers, with a $\ne 0$, then:
$a^m \div a^n = a^{m-n}$
- note: again the bases must be the same.

### Power Rule 3 (0 and 1 powers)
If a is any non-zero real number, then:
$a^0 = 1$ and $a^1 = a$

### Power Rule 4 (Negative Power)
Let a be any non-zero real number and m be any real number, then:
$a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m} = \frac{a^{-m}}{1}$
- In other words what's on the top can be put on the bottom as long as the sign is switched around (from - to + or from + to -)

### Power Rule 5 (Fractional Powers)
Let a be a real number and m be a non-zero real number, then:
$a^{1/m} = \sqrt[m]{a}$
- note that $\sqrt[2]{a}$ is equal to $\sqrt{a}$

### Power Rule 6 (Power Raised to Powers)
If a, b, m and n are real numbers, and b $\ne 0$ in the fraction, then:
$(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$
$(ab)^n = a^nb^n$
$(\frac{a}{b})^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$
