# Absolute Value Inequalities
### Steps for example $|2x-6|>5$

- There are two cases, we must account for when $|2x-6|$ is negative and positive:

1. If $|2x-6| \geq 0$, then $|2x-6| = 2x-6$:
  $\therefore 2x-6 > 5$
  $2x>11$
  $x>\frac{11}{2}$
  
2. If $|2x-6| < 0$, then $|2x-6| = -(2x-6) = -2x+6$:
  $\therefore -2x+6 > 5$
  $-2x>-1$
  $x<\frac{1}{2}$
  
The solution is therefore $x>\frac{11}{2}$ or $x<\frac{1}{2}$


###### Note: If the two solutions were $x>7$ and $x\leq12$, then the answer could be written as $7<x\leq12$
