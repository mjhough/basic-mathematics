# Number Lines & Inequalities
`greater than or equal to:` $\ge$ 
`greater than:` $>$

`less than or equal to:` $\le$
`less than` $<$


## Intervals or ranges
Example Questions: 
- On the real line, mark the interval corresponding to $x > -2 \space and \space x < 3$:
  - Mark two spots on number line with an open dot:
  ![open interval](http://www.mathwords.com/o/o_assets/o30.gif)
  - When the range isn't inclusive of the numbers mentioned, (eg. greater than $-2$ is not inclusive of $-2$ and less than $3$ is not inclusive of $3$) we use open dots and write the interval as $(-2, 3)$

- On the real line, mark the interval corresponding to $x \ge -2 \space and \space x \le 3$:
  - Now, because the interval is inclusive of $-2$ and $-3$ we use closed dots:
  ![closed interval](http://www.mathwords.com/c/c_assets/c38.gif)
  - We write this interval as [-2, 3]

- On the real line, mark the interval corresponding to $x \ge -2 \space and \space x < 3$:
  - Now we use a closed dot for $x \ge -2$ and an open dot for $x < 3$:
  ![half-half interval](http://www.mathwords.com/h/h_assets/h2.gif)
  - This is written as [-2, 3]. The same rule would apply if the interval was $x > -2 \space and \space x \le 3$, however the open and closed dots would be switched around and it would be written like this (-2, 3].
  
  ## Solving Inequalities
  1. The same quantity can be added to, or subtracted from, both sides of the inequality.
  2. Both sides of the inequality can be multiplied by or divided by the same <strong>positive</strong> quantity.
  3. If both sides are multiplied/divided by the same <strong>negative</strong>quantity, then the inequality must be reversed ($<$ becomes $>$ etc)

  Example:
  $-3x + 2 \le 6 - x$
  $-3x + 2 + x \le 6 - x + x$
  $-2x + 2 - 2 \le 6 - 2$
  $-2x \le 4$
  $-2x \div -2 \ge 4 \div -2$ &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Notice sign switch!</strong>
  >$x \ge -2$
